# Simple Interest Calculator


## Overview

This repository contains a simple Python script to calculate **simple interest**, a key concept in financial literacy. This project serves as the first step in transitioning our code management from Subversion (SVN) to Git, aligning with our micro-finance startup’s mission to empower and provide opportunities for low-income individuals.
